**Liquid** unlocks a new capability for Compose Multiplatform: letting modifier nodes sample and manipulate the pixels behind them.
By tagging nodes as `liquefiable`, you can create effects that distort the underlying content in a way that isn't normally possible with Compose's rendering pipeline.

This enables [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Applying-Liquid-Glass-to-custom-views)-style effects like dynamic frosted glass, lenses, and other distortions.
Powered by RuntimeShaders/RuntimeEffects and ModifierNodeElement APIs, it delivers GPU-accelerated visuals to your Compose UI.

## Quick Start

**Add `mavenCentral()` and Liquid to your list of repositories and dependencies:**

```gradle
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation("io.github.fletchmckee.liquid:liquid:1.0.0")
}
```

Below is a simple implementation:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun LiquidScreen(
  modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
  liquidState: LiquidState = rememberLiquidState(),
) = Box(modifier) {
  // Content layer for `liquefiable` source nodes
  ImageBackground(
    Modifier
      .fillMaxSize()
      .liquefiable(liquidState),
  )
  // Control layer for `liquid` effect nodes
  LiquidButton(
    Modifier
      .align(Alignment.TopStart)
      .liquid(liquidState),
  )
}
```

## Acknowledgements

- The [Haze](https://github.com/chrisbanes/haze) library developed by [Chris Banes](https://github.com/chrisbanes) was a large source of
inspiration, particularly for the use of content and effect `Modifier` nodes.
- The original liquid lens effect was inspired by ShaderToy user [4eckme](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/4eckme) with their
[Liquid Glass example](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wcKSRD).
- The current spherical liquid lens effect was inspired by GitHub user [Kyant0](https://github.com/Kyant0) with their own
[AndroidLiquidGlass](https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass) library.
- The dispersion effect was inspired by ShaderToy user [PuZo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/PuZo) with their
[Chromatic Aberration example](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltByR3).
